differently

Changed code to handle dos/unix line endings. Changed configuration to import
operating system homeworks 1 & 2. Also, many changes in whitespace throughout
file.

1.9

cvsimport.php easygdi.php
Started major rewrite to import easycrt (during trip to pittsburgh).
Instead of building a tree and then pruning it for each file, the
new version builds trees which are already pruned. It is also able
to prune in more places like at heads of branches. Also, the
configuration section is now in a separate file.

1.10

cvsimport.php
Continued work on rewrite (on train to NYC)
Renamed lots of variables and classes and tried to remove obvious errors.

1.11

cvsimport.php
- more renaming of variables and classes
- all error checking moved into RevisionList constructor
- File::prepareNodes() is renamed to File::setRevisions() and now has complete
  implementation. Ancient File::DeleteNode() method is finally gone.
- File::writeRCS() is now up to date
- some helper functions at the bottom have been renamed and modified
- MODE_ constants have been moved to the bottom of the file above
  TranslateFile()

easygdi.php
- configuration interface has changed, this file is out of date

1.12

cvsimport.php
- everything except startup code was moved into cvsimport.inc

cvsimport.inc
- based on old cvsimport.php, contains pretty much everything that was in
  that file except startup code
- Fixes to code that prints error messages
- Fixes to RevisionList::scan() function to handle case sensitivity.
- Fixes to File::setRevisions() and File::writeRCS and FileRevision class
  after some testing
- added FileEntry() function for picking log entries out of arrays indexed
  by revision and filename patterns.
- whitespace changes

testcreate.php
- php script that makes it pretty easy to test logic in cvsimport.inc with
  strange corner cases

1.13

cvsimport.inc
- Fixed typo in RevisionList::scan()
- fixed handling of zero, ghost revisions in setRevisions(), realParent() and
  FileRevision()
- fixed a bug in writeRCS() in creating Attic dirs in the base folder
- added function FileRevisionString() to fix display problems when trying to
  print the revision number of  placeholder FileRevision objects
- got rid of debugging code in RevisionList::save() and commented out debugging
  print statments in other parts of the program
- split FileEntry() into two functions: FileEntry() and FileRevisionEntry()
- added array_appen function for appending a the contents of one scalar array
  to another scalar array.

cvsimport.php
- added call to Cleanup() function to allow custom behavior after the
  import completes.

1.14

cvsimport.inc
- changed to mimic behavior of cvs. Dead revisions now hold same the same file
  contents as the previous revision. Before, dead revisions would be given
  whatever contents allow them to have an empty diff. This change only affects
  dead revisions on the trunk, there's no difference between the two behaviors
  on branches.

1.15

cvsimport.inc
- bugfixes
- added automatic testing code

cvsimport.php
- added testing command line option

cvsimport-test.php
- little regression testing suite
- based ont testcreate.php

test.zip
- expected results for regression testing
- stored in a zip file because you can't store a cvs repository in another
  cvs repository. (attic dirs and whatnot)

testcreate.php
- became cvsimport-test.php
